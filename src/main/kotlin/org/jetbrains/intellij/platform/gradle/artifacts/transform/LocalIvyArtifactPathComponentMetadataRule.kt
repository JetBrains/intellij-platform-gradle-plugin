/**
 * This comes into play only when [org.gradle.api.initialization.resolve.RulesMode.PREFER_PROJECT] (the default) is
 * used in Gradle's settings.
 *
 * Fixes relative URLs of dependencies from the local Ivy repository [IntelliJPlatformRepositoriesHelper.createLocalIvyRepository]
 * by appending the full absolute path. It is necessary only for bundledPlugin & bundledModule dependency types.
 *
 *  For bundledPlugin & bundledModule, we expect:
 *  - "artifact" (IvyModule#name) is mandatory and contains only the name of the artifact (e.g. jar archive),
 *    without the extension.
 *
 *  - "url" (IvyModule#type) contains a path, relative to the platformPath (IDE), without the file's name.
 *    According to Ivy's [documentation](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/artifact.html)
 *    > an URL at which this artifact can be found if it isnâ€™t located at the standard location in the repository
 *
 *    It may be not the best to field to put this into, but there is no alternative.
 *
 *    The reason why we put the path into "url" is that the name should not have it, because:
 *        - Artifact name may come up in files like Gradle's verification-metadata.xml which will make
 *          them not portable between different environments.
 *          https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin/issues/1778
 *          https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin/issues/1779
 *          https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html
 *
 *        - Artifact name may also come up in Gradle errors, e.g. if for some reason the artifact is not
 *          resolved. In that case the artifact coordinates may look very weird like:
 *          bundledPlugin:/some/path/more/path/some.jar:123.456.789
 *          For the same reason file extension is also stored in "ext".
 *
 *  - "ext" (IvyModule#ext) is an optional file extension, e.g. "jar". It is optional only because files
 *    do not always have extensions. For directories, it would be "directory", but in this case, we never
 *    expect to have a directory, always only files.
 *
 * Relative paths are better than absolute because if Gradle's dependency verification is used with metadata
 * (e.g., ivy.xml or pom.xml) files verification enabled, hashes of these files will be the same in different
 * environments, despite that they are stored in different locations. If absolute paths are used, they will be
 * mentioned in ivy.xml thus changing the hash on each env.
 *
 * But since our local Ivy repository has an artifact pattern "/[artifact]" relative URLs won't work.
 * See [IntelliJPlatformRepositoriesHelper.createLocalIvyRepository]. That is why this class is needed.
 *
 * This is called after Ivy XML metadata is already found and parsed, so all dependencies and publications are known,
 * but not yet resolved on the file system, so we have a chance to fix the paths.
 *
 * A separate note on [CacheableRule], since there is not enough information on it in the internet.
 * First, see the comments in [org.gradle.internal.resolve.caching.CachingRuleExecutor].
 * I tried to debug it, and it seems like rule parameters are taken into account. It happens in:
 * [org.gradle.internal.resolve.caching.CrossBuildCachingRuleExecutor.computeExplicitInputsSnapshot]
 * Which should mean that we can use the caching, because if the paths change, it should be re-evaluated.
